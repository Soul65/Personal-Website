						<h3>Independently</h3>
						<p>
							At Independently, I worked as a full-stack developer on a SaaS platform that helps
							organizations manage independent contractors. My main focus was building responsive,
							intuitive, and user-friendly interfaces using React and Next.js. I collaborated closely
							with other developers to implement features that improved usability and performance. I
							also contributed to backend development with NestJS and MongoDB, particularly around
							structuring and managing entity schemas, creating API endpoints, and managing user role
							permissions.

						<h3>Alaunus</h3>
						<p>
							At Alaunus, I worked as a front-end developer on a healthcare SaaS platform. My work
							primarily involved developing and maintaining user-facing features using AngularJS. I
							collaborated closely with the backend developers to deliver a seamless user
							experience, contributed to improving UI performance, and helped ensure the app's
							responsiveness and accessibility across devices.

						<h3>SSIMWave</h3>
						<p>
							My first job I worked at was a company called SSIMWave. Their products focused on
							analyzing and optimizing video quality of experience. While
							there I mainly used Javascript with the AngularJS framework. My job focused on changing
							the designs of the web pages into actual HTML code, communicating with the backend so
							that it could start services and collect data to then populate the databases with, and
							then retrieve said data to then display on the interface.

						<h3>College</h3>
						<p>
							I am a graduate of the Computer Programmer / Analyst course at Conestoga College.
							While there I learned a multitude of languages including C#, Javascript, and ASP.NET.
							I received an advanced diploma and am on the Dean's Honor List (80% average in all
							courses with no failed ones).

						<h3>Highschool</h3>
						<p>
							I took computer programming in both grades 11 and 12. This is where I finally started
							to learn the basics of coding. We started by learning Turing and then Java the year
							after. I also went to the Skills Ontario Competition for both 2D and 3D animation. They
							were both really interesting to be in, but also made me realize I wasn't cut out for
							that sort of thing.

						<h3>CrazTechz</h3>
						<p>
							In the summer between grade 5 and 6 I went to a summer camp called CrazTechz. This was
							my first real experience with programming. While there I used adobe flash to create a
							game I could call my own. I enjoyed it so much I went back the next year for the
							intermediate camp.
